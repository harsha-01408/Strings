Title: Minimum Flips to Avoid Three Consecutive Identical Characters

You are given a string s consisting only of the characters 'a' and 'b'.
In one operation, you may flip a single character: change 'a' → 'b' or 'b' → 'a'.

Task
Find the minimum number of operations required so that the final string does NOT
contain three consecutive identical characters (i.e., no substring "aaa" or "bbb").

Input
- A single line containing the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 * 10^5), s[i] ∈ {'a','b'}.

Output
- A single integer: the minimum number of flips.

Hint
Let the string be decomposed into runs of equal characters with lengths L1, L2, ….
The answer is:  sum over all runs of floor(Li / 3).

Examples
1)
Input
aaabbb
Output
2
Explanation
Runs have lengths 3 and 3 → floor(3/3)+floor(3/3)=2. One optimal result: "aabab b".

2)
Input
abba
Output
0
Explanation
There is no "aaa" or "bbb" already.

3)
Input
aaaa
Output
1
Explanation
Run length 4 → floor(4/3)=1; flip one character to break into ≤2-length segments.
